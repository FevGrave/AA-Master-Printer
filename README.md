## Hello, Future modder
You will need to get [BlueAmulet's Mod Loader](https://github.com/BlueAmulet/EDF5ModLoader) and then get either CPK extractors that is listed here. to crack open the CPKs at the root install folder for EDF 4.1 or 5
* [CriPakTools](https://github.com/wmltogether/CriPakTools): CPK extractor with a GUI.
* [YACPKTool](https://github.com/Brolijah/YACpkTool): Drag and drop CPK extractor.

After this the first thing you will need to do is to edit the AA-UserSettings-Porter.txt file to keep your preferred setting to apply to 
the newer vertions of AA-Master-Printer.bat. the only thing you can edit with out issue is between the single quotes 'A example!'
Once done editing the txt file you will save the changes. Then double click the AB-Python-Script-Runner.bat to run it, after this
AA-Master-Printer.bat has been updated with the changes, and this "AA-Master-Printer.bat" file can be copied about, to anywhere in the
unpacked cpk folders that you want to start moding the game

                              "The tool has not been updated since its release. The reason is that further development would require
                              knowledge of other formats (MDB, RAB), which I don't know much about, and I have little experience in
                              programming itself. However, this is not much of a tool, as it is just a tool that is a part of the
                              information on the wiki. I am hoping that someday someone with more knowledge will make a proper one
                              that works with Blender, etc."
