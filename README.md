"The tool has not been updated since its release. The reason is that further development would require
knowledge of other formats (MDB, RAB), which I don't know much about, and I have little experience in
programming itself. However, this is not much of a tool, as it is just a tool that is a part of the
information on the wiki. I am hoping that someday someone with more knowledge will make a proper one
that works with Blender, etc."
