#A-Master-Printer WILL NOT WORK FOR 4.1 but RAB CMDS will work. USE A-Master-Printer-4.1.bat

| WORKHORSE GO BRRRRRRRRRRR | This file needs most of everything on this list https://github.com/KCreator/Earth-Defence-Force-Documentation/wiki/Tools things to work fully |
| ------ | ------ |

| Edit the file pathway for this package | New folder in "SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\EARTH DEFENSE FORCE 5\Mods\TOOLS" |

What does this file is basicly a packaged warhead that spiders out to have quick work flow when editing and file type

Will have to keep holding any key to process all M(RAB)'s

#CMD MAKER is for the making of A-Master-Printer-4.1.bat
